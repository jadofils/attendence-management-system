## University Student Attendance Management System

The University Student Attendance Management System is a Java application that follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern and is structured as a Maven project. This system aims to help universities and colleges efficiently manage student attendance records.

### Features

The key features of the University Student Attendance Management System include:

1. **Student Registration**: Administrators can register new students in the system, capturing their personal details and academic information.

2. **Course and Class Management**: The system allows administrators to create and manage courses, along with their associated classes.

3. **Attendance Marking**: Instructors can mark student attendance for each class session, recording presence, absence, or any other relevant status.

4. **Attendance Reporting**: The system generates comprehensive attendance reports, allowing administrators and instructors to view attendance data, track student performance, and identify any attendance-related issues.

ATTENDANCE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

Create an attendance management system for university-
level graduates using Java, following the MVC architecture,

and employing Maven as a build tool. This system utilizes
MySQL or another database for backend data management
and deploys on a Tomcat server to allow live access and
usage.
5. **Notification System**: The system automatically sends notifications to students and their parents/guardians regarding attendance updates, such as missed classes or poor attendance.

6. **User Authorization**: The system implements role-based access control, ensuring that only authorized users (administrators, instructors, students) can perform specific actions within the application.

### Database Design

The University Student Attendance Management System will use a relational database to store all the necessary data. The database schema will consist of the following main tables:

1. **Students**
   - StudentID (Primary Key)
   - FirstName
   - LastName
   - Email
   - PhoneNumber
   - EnrollmentDate
   - ProgramID (Foreign Key)

2. **Programs**
   - ProgramID (Primary Key)
   - ProgramName
   - ProgramDescription

3. **Courses**
   - CourseID (Primary Key)
   - CourseName
   - CourseDescription
   - Credits
   - ProgramID (Foreign Key)

4. **Classes**
   - ClassID (Primary Key)
   - CourseID (Foreign Key)
   - ClassCode
   - ClassSchedule
   - InstructorID (Foreign Key)

5. **Attendance**
   - AttendanceID (Primary Key)
   - StudentID (Foreign Key)
   - ClassID (Foreign Key)
   - AttendanceDate
   - AttendanceStatus (Present, Absent, Late)

6. **Users**
   - UserID (Primary Key)
   - Username
   - Password
   - Role (Administrator, Instructor, Student)

The database design ensures that the system can effectively manage student information, course and class details, attendance records, and user access. The relationships between the tables allow for efficient data retrieval, updates, and reporting.

### Implementation

The University Student Attendance Management System will be implemented using Java and the Spring Boot framework, following the MVC architecture. The key components of the implementation include:

1. **Models**: The model classes will represent the database entities, such as Student, Course, Class, and Attendance.

2. **Controllers**: The controllers will handle the incoming requests from the user interface, interact with the models, and return the appropriate responses.

3. **Views**: The views will be responsible for rendering the user interface, which can be built using a front-end framework like React or Angular, or a server-side rendering technology like JSP or Thymeleaf.

4. **Repository Layer**: The repository classes will encapsulate the database operations, providing an abstraction layer between the controllers and the database.

5. **Service Layer**: The service classes will contain the business logic, orchestrating the interactions between the controllers and the repositories.

6. **Security**: The system will implement role-based access control using Spring Security, ensuring that users can only perform actions based on their assigned roles (Administrator, Instructor, Student).

7. **Notification System**: The system will use a messaging service, such as email or SMS, to send attendance-related notifications to students and their guardians.

The project will be structured as a Maven project, which will help manage dependencies, build the application, and facilitate testing and deployment.

I hope this detailed overview of the University Student Attendance Management System helps you understand the key features, database design, and implementation approach. Please let me know if you have any further questions or if you would like me to elaborate on any part of the system.
